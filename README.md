# R-ML
This repository contains implementation of various different machine learning algorithms and deep learning models I implemented during my training.<br />

Anyone willing to learn and implement ML algos in R could have a look and test the running examples of different algorithms.<br />
I have also added the dataset used by each code so that there would be no problem in running the codes on your own local machine.<br />
<b> You might need to change path and directory structure on basis of OS you are using . If you are using linux, you are good to go :) </b>
